            <h2>Volunteering for Charity</h2>
            <p>I have a strong passion for volunteering since it allows me to give back to the community and significantly improve the lives of others. Making relationships, being there for people in need, and supporting causes greater than myself are more important than simply volunteering my time. I've learnt that even the simplest deeds of kindness can make a big difference, whether I'm working at shelters, supporting neighbourhood activities, or helping at local food banks.</p>
            <h2>Football</h2>
            <p>One of the highlights of my life has been playing football with my school team. After all the effort, we won trophies together, making memories I will always treasure and teaching me the importance of endurance and teamwork.

I'm a huge Chelsea supporter as well. It motivates me as a player and a fan to watch the team win, whether it's in the league or the Champions League. My passion for the game is fuelled by Chelsea's tenacity and iconic players like Frank Lampard.</p>
